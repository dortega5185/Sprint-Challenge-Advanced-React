- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

So you have access to the component lifecycle. This makes the execution of the class component easier to understand and manipulate.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

componentDidMount method is called after a component is added to the dom.
componentDidUpdate is a method that is called after a setState has executed and is rendered onto the dom
the constructor method sets up the initial state of the class component as is the very first thing that the component executes

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

The purpose is to create dry, reusable code. Custom hooks typically contain stateful logic that can be used throughout an app.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

To ensure there are minimal bugs in the app and that the app performs in the ways that we expect it to.
